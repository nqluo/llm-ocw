## How to limit access to the codespace in public repository by set up OAuth token authentication

Here are the steps to set up OAuth token authentication:

1. Generate a personal access token on your GitHub account by going to your account settings and generating a new token with the appropriate permissions. 
GitHub Copilot: To generate a personal access token on GitHub, you can follow these steps:
Here are the steps: GitHub account settings -> "Developer settings" -> "Personal access tokens" -> "Generate new token".

2. In your Codespace, set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to the value of the personal access token. Add the "export GITHUB_TOKEN=***********" to the end of the `~/.bashrc` file. 
The `.bashrc` file is not lost when you restart your Codespace. The `.bashrc` file is a shell script that is executed every time you start a new terminal session. It is stored in your home directory, which is persistent across restarts of your Codespace.
By adding the `export` command to your `.bashrc` file, you ensure that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set correctly every time you start a new terminal session in your Codespace.
